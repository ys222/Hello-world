    "Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose."
